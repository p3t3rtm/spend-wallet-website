        <section>
            <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>The App relies on third-party services, including but not limited to the Solana blockchain for
                transaction processing and Google Firebase for push notifications. These services are subject to their
                own terms and conditions, and we are not responsible for their performance, availability, or any issues
                arising from their use. You acknowledge that disruptions in these services may affect the functionality
                of the App.</p>

                App, you represent and warrant that you meet the applicable age requirements. If we become aware that a
                user is under the required age, we may terminate their access to the App.</p>

            <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the App at our sole discretion, with or
                without notice, for any reason, including but not limited to violation of these Terms, suspected
                fraudulent activity, or misuse of the App. Upon termination, your right to use the App will cease
                immediately, but your responsibilities regarding the security of your private keys and digital assets
                will remain.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>11. Modification of Terms</h2>
            <p>We may update these Terms from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technology, or other
